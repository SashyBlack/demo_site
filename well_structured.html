          <h2><strong>Bush fallowing</strong></h2>
         </header>
        <p>Bush fallowing is a land-use system involving a form of rotational agriculture with a bush-fallow period, longer than the period of cultivation. The land is used for growing food crop, particularly upland rice for only one to a maximum of three years and fallowed for a relatively long period</p>
        <h3> Advantages of Bush Fallowing</h3>
        <ol start="A">
          <li>Natural vegetation are allowed to grow on their own</li>
          <li>The soil gets to replenish its nutrient/fertility naturally</li>
        </ol>

            <h3>Introduction to Crop Rotation</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Crop rotation is the practice of planting different crops sequentially on the same plot of land to improve soil health, optimize nutrients in the soil, and combat pest and weed pressure. For example, say a farmer has planted a field of corn.</p>

            <h3>Principles of Crop Rotation</h3>
          </header>
          <p>The basic principles of crop rotations are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><mark>Deep rooted crops should be succeeded by shallow rooted crops such as cotton, castor, pigeon pea-potato, lentil, green gram etc.</mark></li>
            <li>Dicot crops should be rotated by monocot crops such as mustard, potato- rice, wheat- sugarcane.</li>
            <li>Grain crops should be followed by foliage crops such as, wheat- dhaincha, black gram.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Cover Cropping</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Cover cropping is the planting of cover crops.<mark>A cover crop is a crop of a specific plant that is grown primarily for the benefit of the soil rather than the crop yield. Cover crops are commonly used to suppress weeds, manage soil erosion, help build and improve soil fertility and quality, control diseases and pests, and promote biodiversity.</mark></p>
